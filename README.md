# ros_rtsp
This is still very much a work in progress.
ROS package to subscribe to an ROS Image topic and serve it up as a RTSP video feed.

## Setup
Change the config/stream_setup.yaml to suit your required streams. There are 2 types to choose from: [cam, topic]. Cam should work with nearly any video source plugin available with gstreamer.
